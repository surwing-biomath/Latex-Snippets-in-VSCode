# Latex-Snippets-in-VSCode

This is a code for Latex in VsCode, which greatly saves your time when typing math commands in vacode. To find how to set the snippet in vacode, tape "Control+Shift+P" in vscode to find "Snippets: Configure Snippets", and then tickle it and find "Latex.json (Latex)". This is the disired root.
